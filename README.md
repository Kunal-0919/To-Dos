To-Dos
This MERN Stack project is a simple but comprehensive way to learn the fundamentals of React.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It also covers the different types of database calls that can be made based on the various services that a database can offer. The user interface is built using Material-UI.
Prerequisites

Material UI dependencies
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/user/mernstack-project.git

Install the dependencies:
npm install

To install the Material UI dependencies, you will need to have npm or yarn installed on your computer.

Using npm:

Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your project.
Run the following command:
npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
This will install all of the necessary Material UI dependencies, including:

@emotion/react: A library for styling React components with Emotion.
@emotion/styled: A library for creating reusable styled components with Emotion.
@material-ui/core: The core Material UI library, which provides a wide range of components such as buttons, menus, and dialogs.

Using yarn:

Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your project.
Run the following command:
yarn add @emotion/react @emotion/styled @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
This will install all of the same Material UI dependencies as npm.

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start using Material UI components in your React project.
